***💞 How to Customize***

**🖊️ 1. Edit Text**

Open any .html file in a text editor (like VS Code, Notepad++, or even basic Notepad).

Look for the text sections like:

<p>Your message here</p>


Replace these with your own words.

You can change the titles, subtitles, and letter content freely.

Save the file after editing.


**🌸 2. Replace Images**

Go to the /images folder.

Replace existing images (like flower.png, gallery1.jpg, etc.) with your own.

Keep the same file names or update the file references inside the .html files.

**🎵 3. Add / Change Music (Optional)**

Place your MP3 file in the /music folder.

Rename it to bgmusic.mp3

The site will automatically play it when the user clicks the sound icon 🎶

**💗 4. Customize Colors**

If you’d like to change background or accent colors:

Open style.css

Look for color codes (like #ffb6c1 or #dce6ee)

Replace them with your preferred shades (you can use htmlcolorcodes.com
 to find nice palettes).

**🕹️ 5. The “Word Game” (Anagram)**

This is optional!
If you want to use it:

Open anagram.html and anagram.js

You can change the letters and valid words in the JS file

Adjust the text or messages if you’d like — or simply remove the game by deleting that page.



**💬 Tips for the Best Experience**

- Test on both mobile and desktop before sharing.

- Keep your message heartfelt — it’s the most beautiful part.

- You can hide the game page if you want only the letter + flowers.

- Optional: add your partner’s photo or a voice note in the gallery!
